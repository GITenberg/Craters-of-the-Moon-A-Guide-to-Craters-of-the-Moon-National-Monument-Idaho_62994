<h4 id="ccc1"><i>Using This Handbook</i></h4>
<p>Craters of the Moon National Monument protects
volcanic features of the Craters of the Moon lava
field. <a href="#c1">Part 1</a> of this handbook introduces the park
and recounts its early exploration. <a href="#c3">Part 2</a> explores
how life has adapted to the park&rsquo;s volcanic landscape&mdash;and
how people have perceived it. <a href="#c7">Part 3</a> presents
concise travel guide and reference materials for touring
the park and for camping.</p>
<p>National Park Handbooks are published to support
the National Park Service&rsquo;s management programs
and to promote understanding and enjoyment of the
more than 350 National Park System sites, which
represent important examples of our country&rsquo;s natural
and cultural inheritance. Each handbook is
intended to be informative reading and a useful
guide before, during, and after a park visit. More
than 100 titles are in print. They are sold at parks
and can be purchased by mail from the Superintendent
of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office,
Washington, DC 20402. This is handbook number 139.</p>

<p>Light playing on cobalt blue lavas of the Blue Dragon
Flows caught the inner eye of explorer Robert Limbert:
&ldquo;It is the play of light at sunset across this lava that
charms the spectator. It becomes a twisted, wavy
sea. In the moonlight its glazed surface has a silvery
sheen. With changing conditions of light and air, it
varies also, even while one stands and watches. It is a
place of color and silence....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Limbert explored the Craters of the Moon lava
field in Idaho in the 1920s and wrote those words for
a 1924 issue of <i>National Geographic Magazine</i>. &ldquo;For
several years I had listened to stories told by fur
trappers of the strange things they had seen while
ranging in this region,&rdquo; wrote Limbert, a sometime
taxidermist, tanner, and furrier from Boise, Idaho.
&ldquo;Some of these accounts seemed beyond belief.&rdquo; To
Limbert it seemed extraordinary &ldquo;That a region of
such size and scenic peculiarity, in the heart of the
great Northwest, could have remained practically
unknown and unexplored....&rdquo; On his third and most
ambitious trek, in 1924, Limbert and W. C. Cole were
at times left speechless by the lava landscape they
explored. Limbert recounted his impressions in magazine
and newspaper articles whose publication was
influential in the area&rsquo;s being protected under federal
ownership. In 1924, part of the lava field was
proclaimed as Craters of the Moon National Monument,
protected under the Antiquities Act. It was
created &ldquo;to preserve the unusual and weird volcanic
formations.&rdquo; The boundary has been adjusted and
the park enlarged since then. In 1970, a large part of
the national monument was designated by Congress
as the Craters of the Moon Wilderness. It is further
protected under the National Wilderness Preservation
System.</p>
<p>Until 1986, little was known about Limbert except
for those facts recounted above. That year, however,
a researcher compiling a history of the national
monument located Limbert&rsquo;s daughter in Boise. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
daughter still possessed hundreds of items, including
early glass plate negatives, photographs, and manuscripts
of her father and that shed more light on his
life, the early days of Idaho, and Craters of the Moon.
Some of these photographs served as blueprints for
the National Park Service in the rehabilitation of
fragile spatter cone formations that have deteriorated
over the years of heavy human traffic. The Limbert
collection has been fully cataloged by Boise State
University curators and has already proven to be a
valuable resource to historians interested in Limbert
and this fascinating part of Idaho. Preservation of
the area owes much to Limbert&rsquo;s imaginative advocacy
in the true spirit of the West in its earlier days.</p>
<p>Local legends, beginning in the late 1800s, held
that this area resembled the surface of the moon, on
which&mdash;it must now be remembered&mdash;no one had
then walked! Geologist Harold T. Stearns first used
the name Craters of the Moon when he suggested to
the National Park Service, in 1923, that a national
monument be established here. Stearns found &ldquo;the
dark craters and the cold lava, nearly destitute of
vegetation&rdquo; similar to &ldquo;the surface of the moon as
seen through a telescope.&rdquo; The name Craters of the
Moon would stick after Limbert adopted it in <i>National
Geographic Magazine</i> in 1924. Later that year
the name became official when the area was set aside
by President Calvin Coolidge as a national monument
under the Antiquities Act.</p>
<p>Like some other areas in the National Park System,
Craters of the Moon has lived to see the name
that its early explorers affixed to it proved somewhat
erroneous by subsequent events or findings. When
Stearns and Limbert called this lava field Craters of
the Moon, probably few persons other than science
fiction buffs actually thought that human beings
might one day walk on the moon and see firsthand
what its surface is like. People have now walked on
the moon, however, and we know that its surface
does not, in fact, closely resemble this part of Idaho.
Although there are some volcanic features on the
surface of the moon, most of its craters were formed
by the impact of meteorites colliding with the moon.</p>
<p>Moonscape or not, early fur trappers avoided the
lava flows along the base of the Pioneer Mountains
at the north of today&rsquo;s park. In doing so, they
followed Indian trails such as one found by Limbert
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
that &ldquo;resembled a light streak winding through the
lava. When the sun was directly overhead it could be
seen to advantage, but at times was difficult to
follow. Think of the years of travel,&rdquo; Limbert marveled,
&ldquo;necessary to make that mark on rock!&rdquo; At
least one Indian trail was destined to become part of
Goodale&rsquo;s Cutoff, an alternative route on the Oregon
Trail that pioneers in wagon trains used in the
1850s and 1860s. Many adjectives early used for this
scene&mdash;weird, barren, exciting, awe-inspiring, monotonous,
astonishing, curious, bleak, mysterious&mdash;still
apply. It is not difficult today to see why
pioneering folk intent on wresting a living from the
land did not tackle this volcanic terrain.</p>
<p>Geologists possessed the proper motivation to
tackle it, however. Curiosity aroused by this lava field
has led several generations of geologists, beginning
with Israel C. Russell in 1901 and Harold T. Stearns
in the 1920s, into a deeper understanding of its
volcanic origins. With ever increasing penetration of
its geological history, the apparent otherworldliness
of Craters of the Moon has retreated&mdash;but not
entirely. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) brought the second set of astronauts
who would walk on the moon to this alien
corner of the galaxy before their moonshot. Here
they studied the volcanic rock and explored an
unusual, harsh, and unforgiving environment before
embarking on their own otherworldly adventure.</p>
<p>Most types of volcanic features in the park can be
seen quite readily by first stopping at the visitor
center and then driving the Loop Road. Far more
features can be seen if you also walk the interpretive
trails at the stops along the Loop Road. Still more
await those who invest the time required to come to
feel the mysterious timelessness and raw natural
force implicit in this expansive lava field. Many
travelers are en route to Yellowstone National Park
and spend only a couple of hours visiting Craters of
the Moon. This is ironic because here you are on the
geological track of Yellowstone. In fact, Craters of
the Moon represents what Yellowstone&rsquo;s landscape
will resemble in the future, and both areas can supplement
your insight into what happens when the
Earth&rsquo;s unimaginable inner forces erupt to its surface.</p>

<p>Although Idaho is famous for forests, rivers, and
scenic mountain wilderness, its Snake River Plain
region boasts little of these attributes. This plain arcs
across southern Idaho from the Oregon border to
the Yellowstone area at the Montana-Wyoming border.
It marks the trail of the passage of the Earth&rsquo;s
crust over an unusual geologic heat source that now
brings the Earth&rsquo;s incendiary inner workings so close
to its surface near Yellowstone. This heat source
fuels Yellowstone&rsquo;s bubbling, spewing, spouting geothermal
wonders. Craters of the Moon therefore
stands as a geologic prelude to Yellowstone, as its
precursor and the ancestral stuff of its fiery secrets.</p>
<p>When did all this volcanism at Craters of the
Moon happen? Will it happen again? According to
Mel Kuntz and other U.S. Geological Survey geologists
who have conducted extensive field research at
Craters of the Moon, the volcanic activity forming
the Craters of the Moon lava field probably started
<i>only</i> 15,000 years ago. The last eruption in the
volcanic cycle ended 2,000 years ago, about the time
that Julius Caesar ruled the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Craters of the Moon is a dormant, but not extinct,
volcanic area. Its sleeping volcanoes could become
active again in the near future. The largest earthquake
of the last quarter century in the contiguous
United States shook Idaho&rsquo;s tallest mountain, Borah
Peak, just north of here in 1983. When it did, some
geologists wondered if it might initiate volcanic
activity at Craters of the Moon. It did not. According
to Kuntz, however, this is no reason not to expect
another volcanic eruption here <i>soon</i>&mdash;probably &ldquo;within
the next 1,000 years.&rdquo; Part Two of this handbook
explores the still young and rapidly evolving understanding
of the fascinating geologic story of Craters
of the Moon.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Craters of the Moon National Monument
encompasses 83 square miles of the much larger
Craters of the Moon lava field. Reaching southeastward
from the Pioneer Mountains, the park boundary
encloses a series of fissure vents, volcanic cones,
and lava flows known as the Great Rift volcanic
zone. This volcanic rift zone is a line of weakness in
the Earth&rsquo;s crust that can be traced for some 60 miles
across the Snake River Plain. Recent volcanism
marks much of its length. You can explore the Great
Rift and some of its volcanic features via the park&rsquo;s
7-mile Loop Drive, as described in Part Three of this
handbook. In the park&rsquo;s northern part you will find
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
spatter cones, cinder cones, lava flows, lava caves,
and an unexpected variety of wildflowers, shrubs,
trees, and wild animals. The much larger southern
part of the park, designated by Congress in 1970 as
the Craters of the Moon Wilderness Area, is a vast
and largely untraveled region of stark volcanic features
flanking the Great Rift. It offers a challenge to
serious hikers and explorers&mdash;latter day Robert
Limberts&mdash;who are prepared for rugged wilderness
travel.</p>
<p>Despite its seeming barrenness, Craters of the
Moon is indeed home to a surprising diversity of
plant and animal life. As Limbert noted in 1924: &ldquo;In
the West the term &lsquo;Lava Beds of Idaho&rsquo; has always
signified a region to be shunned by even the most
venturesome travelers&mdash;a land supposedly barren of
vegetation, destitute of water, devoid of animal life,
and lacking in scenic interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In reality the region has slight resemblance to its
imagined aspect. Its vegetation is mostly hidden in
pockets, but when found consists of pines, cedars,
junipers, and sagebrush: its water is hidden deep in
tanks or holes at the bottom of large &lsquo;blow-outs&rsquo; and
is found only by following old Indian or mountain
sheep trails or by watching the flight of birds as they
drop into these places to quench their thirst. The
animal life consists principally of migrant birds, rock
rabbits, woodchucks, black and grizzly bears: its
scenery is impressive in its grandeur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Years of patient record-keeping by scientists have
fit numbers to Limbert&rsquo;s perceptive observations.
The number of species identified includes more than
300 plants, 2,000 insects, 8 reptiles, 140 birds, 30
mammals&mdash;and one amphibian, the western toad.
We now call Limbert&rsquo;s &ldquo;rock rabbit&rdquo; the pika. The
grizzly is long gone here. With few exceptions, the
park&rsquo;s denizens live mostly under conditions of great
environmental stress.</p>
<p>Near constant winds, breeze-to-gale in strength,
sweep across the park to rob moisture from all living
things. Scant soils, low levels of precipitation, the
inability of cinder cones to hold rainwater near the
surface, and the heat of the summer sun&mdash;intensified
by heat-absorbing black lavas&mdash;only aggravate such
moisture theft. Cinder surfaces register summer soil
temperatures of over 150&deg;F and show a lack of plant
cover. Plants cover generally less than 5 percent of
the total surface of the cinder cones. A recent study
found that when the area is looked at on a parkwide
basis, most of the land is very sparsely vegetated (less
than 15 percent vegetative cover). On a scale of sand
trap to putting green, this would approach the sand
trap end of the scale.</p>

<p>Into this difficult environment wildlife researcher
Brad Griffith ventured to count, mark, and scrutinize
the mule deer of Craters of the Moon in May
1980. Griffith, of the University of Idaho, conducted
a three-year study of the park&rsquo;s mule deer population
because the National Park Service was concerned
that this protected and productive herd might multiply
so much that it would eventually damage its
habitat. Among other things, he would find that the
herd has developed a drought evasion strategy that
makes it behave unlike any mule deer population
known anywhere else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By late summer,&rdquo; Griffith explains, &ldquo;plants have
matured and dried so that they no longer provide
adequate moisture to sustain the deer in this landscape
that offers them no free water. Following about
12 days of warm nights and hot days in late July, the
deer migrate from 5 to 10 miles north to the Pioneer
Mountains. There they find free-flowing creeks and
the cool, moist shade of aspen and Douglas-fir
groves and wait out summer&rsquo;s worst heat and dryness.
Early fall rains trigger the deer&rsquo;s return to the
park&rsquo;s wilderness from this oasis in late September to
feed on the nutritious bitterbrush until November
snowfalls usher them back to their winter range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pristine and high-quality forage of the Craters
of the Moon Wilderness Area, historically nearly
untouched by domestic livestock grazing, has inspired
this migratory strategy for evading drought. In
effect, the mule deer make use of a dual summer
range, a behavioral modification unknown elsewhere
for their species.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their late summer and fall adaptations simply
complete the mule deer&rsquo;s yearlong strategy for coping
with the limits that this volcanic landscape
imposes on them,&rdquo; Griffith explains.</p>
<p>Taking a walk in the park on a mid-summer
afternoon gives you a good opportunity to experience
the influence of wind, heat, and lack of moisture.
The park&rsquo;s winds are particularly striking. The
lava that has flowed out of the Great Rift has built up
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
and raised the land surface in the park to a higher
elevation than its surroundings so that it intercepts
the prevailing southwesterly winds. Afternoon winds
usually die down in the evening. As part of the
dynamics of temperature and moisture that determine
mule deer behavior, this daily wind cycle helps
explain why they are more active at night than are
mule deer elsewhere. These deer do not move around
as much as mule deer in less ecologically trying
areas. They have adapted behaviors to conserve
energy and moisture in this environmentally stressful
landscape.</p>
<p>Early mornings may find park rangers climbing up
a cinder cone to count the deer, continuing the
collection of data that Brad Griffith set in motion
with his three-year study. The rangers still conduct
spring and late summer censuses: over a recent
three-year period the deer populations averaged
about 420 animals. Another several years of collecting
will give the National Park Service a body of data
on the mule deer that is available nowhere else.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of this data about the park&rsquo;s mule
deer population would surely please the booster
aspect of Robert Limbert&rsquo;s personality. Likewise, the
research challenges involved in obtaining it would
appeal to his explorer self. History has justified
Limbert on both counts. Publicity arising from his
explorations led to creation of the national monument.
Furthermore, that publicity put forth a rather
heady claim that history has also unequivocally
borne out: &ldquo;Although almost totally unknown at
present,&rdquo; Limbert prophesied in 1924, &ldquo;this section
is destined some day to attract tourists from all
America....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every year tens of thousands of travelers fulfill
Robert Limbert&rsquo;s prophecy of more than a half-century
ago.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">Geology of the Craters of the Moon</span></h2>
<p>A 400-mile-long arc known as the Snake River Plain
cuts a swath from 30 to 125 miles wide across
southern Idaho. Idaho&rsquo;s official state highway map,
which depicts mountains with shades of green, shows
this arc as white because there is comparatively little
variation here compared to most of the state. Upon
this plain, immense amounts of lava from within the
Earth have been deposited by volcanic activity dating
back more than 14 million years. However, some of
these lavas, notably those at Craters of the Moon
National Monument, emerged from the Earth as
recently as 2,000 years ago. Craters of the Moon
contains some of the best examples of basaltic
volcanism in the world. To understand what happened
here, you must understand the Snake River Plain.</p>
<p><b>Basaltic and Rhyolitic Lavas.</b> The lavas deposited
on the Snake River Plain were mainly of two types
classified as basaltic and rhyolitic. Magma, the molten
rock material beneath the surface of the Earth,
issues from a volcano as lava. The composition of
this fluid rock material varies. Basaltic lavas are
composed of magma originating at the boundary of
the Earth&rsquo;s mantle and its crustal layer. Rhyolitic
lavas originate from crustal material. To explain its
past, geologists now divide the Snake River Plain
into eastern and western units. The following geologic
story relates to the eastern Snake River Plain, on
which Craters of the Moon lies.</p>
<p>On the eastern Snake River Plain, basaltic and
rhyolitic lavas formed in two different stages of
volcanic activity. Younger basaltic lavas mostly lie
atop older rhyolitic lavas. This portion of the plain
runs from north of Twin Falls eastward to the
Yellowstone area on the Wyoming-Montana border.
Drilling to depths of almost 2 miles near the plain&rsquo;s
midline, geologists found &frac12; mile of basaltic lava
flows lying atop more than 1&frac12; miles of rhyolitic lava
flows. How much deeper the rhyolitic lavas may
extend is not known. No one has drilled deeper here.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/i10.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="591" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Crossing Idaho in an arc, the
Snake River Plain marks the
path of the Earth&rsquo;s crustal
plate as it migrates over a
heat source unusually close
to the surface. It is believed
that the heat source fueling
Yellowstone&rsquo;s thermal features
today is essentially the same
one that produced volcanic
episodes at Craters of the
Moon ending about 2,000
years ago.</i></p>
</div>
<p>This combination&mdash;a thinner layer of younger
basaltic lavas lying atop an older and thicker layer of
rhyolitic lavas&mdash;is typical of volcanic activity associated
with an unusual heat phenomenon inside the Earth
that some geologists have described as a mantle
plume. The mantle plume theory was developed in
the early 1970s as an explanation for the creation of
the Hawaiian Islands. According to the theory, uneven
heating within the Earth&rsquo;s core allows some material
in the overlying mantle to become slightly hotter
than surrounding material. As its temperature
increases, its density decreases. Thus it becomes
relatively buoyant and rises through the cooler
materials&mdash;like a tennis ball released underwater&mdash;toward
the Earth&rsquo;s crust. When this molten material
reaches the crust it eventually melts and pushes itself
through the crust and it erupts onto the Earth&rsquo;s
surface as molten lava.</p>
<p>The Earth&rsquo;s crust is made up of numerous plates
that float upon an underlying mantle layer. Therefore,
over time, the presence of an unusual heat source
created by a mantle plume will be expressed at the
Earth&rsquo;s surface&mdash;floating in a constant direction
above it&mdash;as a line of volcanic eruptions. The Snake
River Plain records the progress of the North American
crustal plate&mdash;350 miles in 15 million years&mdash;over a
heat source now located below Yellowstone. The
Hawaiian chain of islands marks a similar line.
Because the mechanisms that cause this geologic
action are not well understood, many geologists refer
to this simply as a heat source rather than a mantle
plume.</p>
<p><b>Two Stages of Volcanism.</b> As described above,
volcanic eruptions associated with this heat source
occur in two stages, rhyolitic and basaltic. As the
upwelling magma from the mantle collects in a
chamber as it enters the Earth&rsquo;s lower crust, its heat
begins to melt the surrounding crustal rock. Since
this rock contains a large amount of silica, it forms a
thick and pasty rhyolitic magma. Rhyolitic magma is
lighter than the overlying crustal rocks, therefore, it
begins to rise and form a second magma chamber
very close to the Earth&rsquo;s surface. As more and more
of this gas-charged rhyolitic magma collects in this
upper crustal chamber, the gas pressure builds to a
point at which the magma explodes through the
Earth&rsquo;s crust.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p><b>Explosive Rhyolitic Volcanism.</b> Rhyolitic explosions
tend to be devastating. When the gas-charged
molten material reaches the surface of the Earth, the
gas expands rapidly, perhaps as much as 25 to 75
times by volume. The reaction is similar to the
bubbles that form in a bottle of soda pop that has
been shaken. You can shake the container and the
pressure-bottled liquid will retain its volume as long
as the cap is tightly sealed. Release the pressure by
removing the bottle cap, however, and the soft drink
will spray all over the room and occupy a volume of
space far larger than the bottle from which it issued.
This initial vast spray is then followed by a foaming
action as the less gas-charged liquid now bubbles out
of the bottle.</p>
<p>Collectively, the numerous rhyolitic explosions
that occurred on the Snake River Plain ejected
hundreds of cubic miles of material into the atmosphere
and onto the Earth&rsquo;s surface. In contrast, the eruption
of Mount Saint Helens in 1980, which killed 65
people and devastated 150 square miles of forest,
produced less than 1 cubic mile of ejected material.
So much material was ejected in the massive rhyolitic
explosions in the Snake River Plain that the Earth&rsquo;s
surface collapsed to form huge depressions known as
calderas. (Like <i>caldron</i>, whose root meaning it shares,
this name implies both bowl-shaped and warmed.)
Most evidence of these gigantic explosive volcanoes
in the Snake River Plain has been covered by
subsequent flows of basaltic lava. However, traces of
rhyolitic eruptions are found along the margins of
the plain and in the Yellowstone area.</p>
<p><b>Quiet Outpourings of Basaltic Lava.</b> As this area
of the Earth&rsquo;s crust passed over and then beyond the
sub-surface heat source, the explosive volcanism of
the rhyolitic stage ceased. The heat contained in the
Earth&rsquo;s upper mantle and crust, however, remained
and continued to produce upwelling magma. This
was basaltic magma that, because it contained less
silica than rhyolite, was very fluid.</p>
<p>The basalt, like the rhyolite, collected in isolated
magma chambers within the crust until pressures
built up to force it to the surface through various
cracks and fissures. These weak spots in the Earth&rsquo;s
crust were the results of earlier geologic activity,
expansion of the magma chamber, or the formation
of a rift zone.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the surface, the gases contained
within the lava easily escaped and produced rather
mild eruptions. Instead of exploding into the air like
earlier rhyolitic activity, the more fluid basaltic lava
flooded out onto the surrounding landscape. These
flows were fairly extensive and often covered many
square miles. After millions of years, most of the
older rhyolitic deposits have been covered by these
basaltic lava flows.</p>
<p><b>The Great Rift and Craters of the Moon.</b> Craters
of the Moon National Monument lies along a volcanic
rift zone. Rift zones occur where the Earth&rsquo;s crust is
being pulled in opposite directions. Geologists believe
that the interactions of the Earth&rsquo;s crustal plates in
the vicinity of the Snake River Plain have stretched,
thinned, and weakened the Earth&rsquo;s crust so that
cracks have formed both on and below the surface
here. Magma under pressure can follow these cracks
and fissures to the surface. While there are many
volcanic rift zones throughout the Snake River Plain,
the most extensive is the Great Rift that runs through
Craters of the Moon. The Great Rift is approximately
60 miles long and it ranges in width from 1&frac12; to 5
miles. It is marked by short cracks&mdash;less than 1 mile
in length&mdash;and the alignment of more than 25 volcanic
cinder cones. It is the site of origin for more than 60
different lava flows that make up the Craters of the
Moon Lava Field.</p>
<p><b>Eight Major Eruptive Periods.</b> Most of the lavas
exposed at Craters of the Moon formed between
2,000 and 15,000 years ago in basaltic eruptions that
comprise the second stage of volcanism associated
with the mantle plume theory. These eight eruptive
periods each lasted about 1,000 years or less and
were separated by periods of relative calm that
lasted for a few hundred to more than 2,000 years.
These sequences of eruptions and calm periods are
caused by the alternating build up and release of
magmatic pressure inside the Earth. Once an eruption
releases this pressure, time is required for it to build
up again.</p>
<p>Eruptions have been dated by two methods:
paleomagnetic and radiocarbon dating. Paleomagnetic
dating compares the alignment of magnetic minerals
within the rock of flows with past orientations of the
Earth&rsquo;s magnetic fields. Radiocarbon dating makes
use of radioactive carbon-14 in charcoal created
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
from vegetation that is overrun by lava flows. Dates
obtained by both methods are considered to be
accurate to within about 100 years.</p>
<p><b>A Typical Eruption at Craters of the Moon.</b> Research
at the monument and observations of similar
eruptions in Hawaii and Iceland suggest the following
scenario for a typical eruption at Craters of the
Moon. Various forces combine to cause a section of
the Great Rift to pull apart. When the forces that
tend to pull the Earth&rsquo;s crust apart are combined
with the forces created as magma accumulates, the
crust becomes weakened and cracks form. As the
magma rises buoyantly within these cracks, the
pressure exerted on it is reduced and the gases
within the magma begin to expand. As gas continues
to expand, the magma becomes frothy.</p>
<p>At first the lava is very fluid and charged with gas.
Eruptions begin as a long line of fountains that reach
heights of 1,000 feet or less and are up to a mile in
length. This &ldquo;curtain of fire eruption&rdquo; mainly produces
cinders and frothy, fluid lava. After hours or
days, the expansion of gases decreases and eruptions
become less violent. Segments of the fissure seal off
and eruptions become smaller and more localized.
Cinders thrown up in the air now build piles around
individual vents and form cinder cones.</p>
<p>With further reductions in the gas content of the
magma, the volcanic activity again changes. Huge
outpourings of lava are pumped out of the various
fissures or the vents of cinder cones and form lava
flows. Lava flows may form over periods of months or
possibly a few years. Long-term eruptions of lava
flows from a single vent become the source of most
of the material produced during a sustained eruption.
As gas pressure falls and magma is depleted, flows
subside. Finally, all activity stops.</p>
<p><b>When Will the Next Eruption Occur?</b> Craters of
the Moon is not an extinct volcanic area. It is merely
in a dormant stage of its eruptive sequence. By
dating the lava flow, geologists have shown that the
volcanic activity along the Great Rift has been
persistent over the last 15,000 years, occurring
approximately every 2,000 years. Because the last
eruptions took place about 2,000 years ago, geologists
believe that eruptions are due here again&mdash;probably
within the next 1,000 years.</p>

lava within the molten core
gradually begins to drop. The

Big Craters/Spatter Cones

lava was pumped out here,
forming the Blue Dragon
Flows. (Hundreds of tiny crystals

huge ponds whose surfaces

cooled and began to harden.

<p><b>Cinder Cones</b> When volcanic
eruptions of fairly moderate
strength throw cinders into the
air, cinder cones may be built
up. These cone-shaped hills
are usually truncated, looking
as though their tops were sliced
off. Usually, a bowl- or funnel-shaped
crater will form inside
the cone. Cinders, which
cooled rapidly while falling
through the air, are highly
porous with gas vesicles, like
bubbles. Cinder cones hundreds
of feet high may be built
in a few days. Big Cinder Butte
is a cinder cone. At 700 feet
high it is the tallest cone in
the park. The shape develops
because the largest fragments,
and in fact most of the fragments,
fall closest to the vent.
The angle of slope is usually
about 30 degrees. Some cinder
cones, such as North Crater,
the Watchman, and Sheep
Trail Butte, were built by more
than one eruptive episode.
Younger lava was added to
them as a vent was rejuvenated.
If strong winds prevailed
during a cinder cone&rsquo;s
formation, the cone may be
elongated&mdash;in the direction the
wind was blowing&mdash;rather than
circular. Grassy, Paisley, Sunset,
and Inferno Cones are
elongated to the east because
the dominant winds in this
area come from the west. The
northernmost section of the
Great Rift contains the most
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
cinder cones for three reasons:
<b>1.</b> There were more eruptions
at that end of the rift. <b>2.</b> The
lavas erupted there were
thicker, resulting in more explosive
eruptions. (They are
more viscous because they
contain more silica.) <b>3.</b> Large
amounts of groundwater may
have been present at the northern
boundary of the lavas and
when it came in contact with
magma it generated huge
amounts of steam. All of these
conditions lead to more extensive
and more explosive eruptions
that tend to create cinder
cones rather than lava flows.</p>
<p><b>Spatter Cones</b> When most of
its gas content has dissipated,
lava becomes less frothy and
more tacky. Then it is tossed
out of the vent as globs or
clots of lava paste called spatter.
The clots partially weld
together to build up spatter
cones. Spatter cones are typically
much smaller than cinder
cones, but they may have
steeper sides. The Spatter
Cones area of the park (Stop 5
on the <a href="#c10">map of the Loop Drive</a>)
contains one of the most perfect
spatter-cone chains in the
world. These cones are all less
than 50 feet high and less than
100 feet in diameter.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">Life Adapts to a Volcanic Landscape</span></h2>
<p>Two thousand years after volcanic eruptions subsided,
plants and animals still struggle to gain toeholds on
this unforgiving lava field. Much of the world&rsquo;s
vegetation could not survive here at all. Environmental
stresses created by scant soil and minimal moisture
are compounded by highly porous cinders that are
incapable of holding water near the ground surface
where plants and other organisms can make ready
use of it. Scarce at best&mdash;total average precipitation
is between 15 to 20 inches per year&mdash;rainwater and
snowmelt quickly slip down out of reach of the
plants growing on cinder cones. Summer&rsquo;s hot, dry
winds rob moisture from all living things exposed to
them. Whisking across leaves and needles the winds
carry away moisture precious to plant tissues. On the
side of a cinder cone, summer day temperatures at
ground level can be more than 150&deg;F.</p>
<p>The secret to survival here is adaptation. Most life
forms cope by strategies of either resisting or evading
the extremes of this semi-arid climate. To resist
being robbed of moisture by winds and heat, a plant
may feature very small leaves that minimize moisture
loss. To evade heat, wind, and aridity, another plant
may grow inside a crevice that provides life-giving
shade and collects precious moisture and soil particles.
Another plant may spend about 95 percent of the
year dormant. It may rush through the germination,
sprouting, leafing out, blooming, and fruiting stages
and return to the dormancy of its seed stage in just
two weeks. The dwarf buckwheat has adapted to life
on porous cinders by evolving a root system that may
spread out for up to 3 feet to support its aboveground
part, which is a mere 4 inches high. This buckwheat
only looks like a dwarf because you can not see its
roots.</p>

<p>Water is the limiting factor in
plant growth and reproduction
both on the lava fields of Craters
of the Moon and on the
surrounding sagebrush steppe.
Plants have developed a combination
of adaptations to cope
with drought conditions. There
are three major strategies:</p>
<p><b>1. Drought tolerance</b> Physiological
adaptations leading to
drought tolerance are typical
of desert plant species. The
tissues of some plants can withstand
extreme dehydration
without suffering permanent
cell damage. Some plants can
extract water from very dry
soils. Sagebrush and antelope
bitterbrush exemplify drought
tolerance.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p><b>2. Drought avoidance</b> Certain
structural modifications can
enable plants to retain or conserve
water. Common adaptations
of this type include small
leaves, hairiness, and succulence.
The small leaves of the
antelope bitterbrush expose
less area to evaporative influences
such as heat and wind.
Hairs on the scorpionweed reduce
surface evaporation by
inhibiting air flow and reflecting
sunlight. Succulent plants
such as pricklypear cactus
have tissues that can store
water for use during drought
periods. Other plants, such
as wire lettuce, avoid drought
by having very little leaf surface
compared to their overall
volume.</p>
<p><b>3. Drought escape</b>  Some
plants, such as mosses and
ferns, escape drought by growing
near persistent water supplies
such as natural potholes
and seeps from ice caves.
Many other drought escapers,
such as dwarf monkeyflower,
simply carry out their full life
cycle during the moist time of
the year. The rest of the year
they survive in seed form.</p>

<p><b>Lava flows</b> Most plants cannot
grow on lava flows until
enough soil has accumulated
to support them. The park&rsquo;s
older volcanic landscapes,
where soils are best developed,
are clothed with sagebrush-grassland
vegetation. On younger
lava flows, bits of soil first
accumulate in cracks, joints,
and crevices. It is in these
microhabitats that vascular
plants may gain footholds. Narrow
cracks and joints may contain
desert parsley and lava
phlox. Shallow crevices will
hold scabland penstemon,
fernleaf fleabane, and gland
cinquefoil. Deep crevices can
support the syringa, various
ferns, bush rockspirea, tansybush,
and even limber pine.
Not until full soil cover is
achieved can the antelope
bitterbrush, rubber rabbitbrush,
and sagebrush find suitable
niches. On lava flows soils first
form from eroded lava and the
slow decomposition of lichens
and other plants able to colonize
bare rock. These soils can
be supplemented by wind-blown
soil particles until vascular
plants gain footholds. As
plants begin to grow and then
die, their gradual decomposition
adds further soil matter.
These soil beginnings accumulate
in cracks and crevices,
which also provide critical
shade and wind protection.
Deep crevices provide lower
temperatures favoring plant
survival.</p>

by plants. Here, too, however,
volcanic origins influence plant
growth. Compared to the relatively
level lava flows, steeply
sloping cinder cones introduce
a new factor that controls the
development of plant communities:
topography. Here you
find marked differences in the
plant communities between
the north- and south-facing
slopes. South-facing slopes are
exposed to prolonged, intense
sunlight, resulting in high evaporation
of water. Because of
the prevailing winds, snow
accumulates on northeast
sides of cones, giving them
far more annual water than
southwest-facing sides receive.
The pioneering herbs that first
colonize cinder cones will persist
on southwest-facing slopes
long after succeeding plant
communities have come to
dominate north-facing slopes.
It is on these north-facing
slopes that limber pine first
develops in the cinder garden.
South-facing slopes may never
support the limber pine but
may be dominated by shrubs.
Unweathered cinder particles

<p>Ecological conditions at Craters of the Moon are
generally so harsh that slight changes can make the
difference for the survival of a plant or other organism.
Life thrives in many rock crevices that are surrounded
by barren exposed lava rock of the same physical
composition. These microhabitats provide the critical
shade and increased soil and moisture content required
for plant survival. Over the years, particles of soil will
naturally collect in rock crevices, which also have
the effect of funneling precipitation into their depths.
Their shade further protects these pockets of soil
and water from wind erosion, excessive heat, and
evaporation and leaching by direct sunlight.</p>

soil cover and then vegetative cover can develop on
these lava flows only after crevices have first become
filled with soil.</p>
<p>Plants exploit other means of protection to survive
in this harsh environment. Shaded and wind-sheltered,
the northern side of a cinder cone can support grass,
shrubs, and limber pine trees while the cone&rsquo;s southern
face supports only scattered herbs. Most cinder
cones in the park show distinct differences of plant
cover between their northern and southern exposures.
Northern exposures are cooler and more moist than
southern exposures, which receive far more direct
sunlight. In addition, here at Craters of the Moon,
the prevailing southwesterly winds compound the
ability of the dry heat to rob porous cinder cone
surfaces and their living organisms of precious
moisture.</p>
<p>The build-up of successive lava flows has so raised
the landscape that it now intercepts wind currents
that operate higher above surrounding plains. Limber
pine trees find footholds on the shaded and sheltered
northern exposures of cinder cones. Bitterbrush and
rabbitbrush shrubs that can barely survive on the
lower skirts of a cinder cone&rsquo;s southern side may
grow two-thirds of the way up its protected northern
face. For many species of plants the limits of habitability
on this volcanic landscape are narrowly defined.
Very small variations in their situations can determine
success or failure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Travelers often ask park rangers whether or not
some of the park&rsquo;s plants were planted by people.
The plants in question are dwarf buckwheats and
grow in cinder gardens. It is their incredibly even
spacing that creates an orderliness that is easy to
mistake for human design. The regular spacing comes
about because of the competition for moisture,
however. The root systems of these plants exploit the
available water from an area of ground surface much
larger than the spread of their foliage. In this way,
mature plants can fend off competition by using the
moisture that would be required for a potentially
encroaching plant to become established. The effect
is an even spacing that makes it appear, indeed, as
though someone had set out the plants on measured
centers.</p>
<p>Craters of the Moon abounds with these surprising
plant microhabitats that delight explorers on foot.
The bleak lava flows separate these emerging pockets
of new life, isolating them like islands or oases within
their barren volcanic surroundings.</p>
<p>Scientists have studied Carey Kipuka, an island of
plantlife in the most southern part of the park, to
find out what changes have occurred in the biologic
community. <i>Kipuka</i> is a Hawaiian name given to an
area of older land that is surrounded by younger lava
flows. Recent lava flows did not overrun Carey Kipuka,
so its plant cover is unaltered. Shortage of water
protected it from livestock grazing that might have
changed its character. Its vegetation is a benchmark
for comparing plant cover changes on similar sites
throughout southern Idaho.</p>
<p>For the National Park Service and other managers
of wildlands, kipukas&mdash;representing isolated and
pristine plant habitat unchanged by human influence&mdash;provide
the best answer that we have to the important
question, &ldquo;What is natural?&rdquo; Armed with a satisfactory
answer to that question, it is possible to manage the
land ecologically. Park managers can seek to restore
natural systems and to allow them to be as self-regulating
as possible. It is ironic that Craters of the
Moon, a volcanic landscape subjected to profound
change, should also protect this informative glimpse
of what remains unchanged.</p>

<img src="images/i20.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="700" height="667" />
</div>
<blockquote class="ssn">
<p>Brad Griffith could be called
the mule deer man. In 1980,
this wildlife researcher began
a three-year study of the mule
deer herd that summers in the
park. The immediate concern
was that the deer, protected
inside the park, might be
overpopulating their range
and endangering their habitat.
Griffith set out to find out just
how the deer use the area,
what their population level
is, and how certain factors&mdash;production,
mortality, and distribution&mdash;affect
their population
dynamics. The mule deer
use the park April through
November only, because winter
brings snows too deep for
the deer to find food here.
The most striking finding of
Griffith&rsquo;s research is that the
mule deer at Craters of the
Moon&mdash;unlike mule deer studied
elsewhere&mdash;have a dual
summer range. Put simply, the
mule deer have had to undergo
behavior modification to live
here. The deer move back into
the southern park in mid-April,
living in the protected wilderness
area there. While in the
wilderness area, the park&rsquo;s
deer routinely live up to nearly
10 miles from open water, getting
their water from food, dew,
fog, and temporary puddles.
This area has higher quality
forage for these deer than any
other part of their annual
range. The trade-off is that the
wilderness area has almost no
open water. When the moisture
content of their forage
decreases in summer, usually
in July, the deer move up to
the northern part of the park
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
where there is open water.
Their habits in the northern
part of the park are unusual,
too, Griffith says, because
there the deer live in much
closer quarters than other
herds are known to tolerate on
summer ranges. They live in
this wildlife equivalent of an
apartment complex until the
fall rains come. Then they
move back down to the wilderness
area. The deer make this
unusual summer migration,
Griffith suggests, to avail themselves
of the high quality forage
in the southern park. &ldquo;The
park serves as an island of
high quality habitat for mule
deer,&rdquo; he wrote in his report. It
is now known the deer will
leave the wilderness area for
the northern park after 12 days
with daytime highs above
80&deg;F and nighttime lows
above 50&deg;F in summer. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t really predict this,&rdquo; Park
Ranger Neil King says, &ldquo;but
the deer know when this is.&rdquo;
What is happening is that the
percentage of water in their
forage plants falls below what
is necessary to sustain the deer
with increasingly hot weather.
As you would expect, does
nursing two fawns leave a couple
days earlier than does with
only one fawn. The rate at
which their fawns survive to
the fall of the year is astonishing.
&ldquo;This is an incredibly productive
herd,&rdquo; Griffith says,
&ldquo;right up there with the highest
fawn survival rate of any
western mule deer herd.&rdquo; Park
rangers continue Griffith&rsquo;s
studies by taking deer census
counts.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">Indians, Early Explorers And Practicing Astronauts</span></h2>
<p>Not surprisingly, archeologists have concluded that
Indians did not make their homes on this immense
lava field. Astronauts would one day trek about
Craters of the Moon in hopes that experiencing its
harshly alien environment would make walking on
the moon less disorienting for them. No wonder
people have not chosen to live on these hot, black,
sometimes sharp lava flows on which you must line
the flight of doves to locate drinking water.</p>
<p>Indians did traverse this area on annual summer
migrations, however, as shown by the developed trails
and many sites where artifacts of Northern Shoshone
culture have been found. Most of these archeological
sites are not easily discerned by the untrained eye,
but the stone windbreaks at Indian Tunnel are easily
examined. Rings of rocks that may have been used
for temporary shelter, hunting blinds, or religious
purposes, numerous stone tools, and the hammerstones
and chippings of arrowhead making are found scattered
throughout the lava flows. Some of the harder, dense
volcanic materials found here were made into crude
cutting and scraping tools and projectile points.
Such evidence suggests only short forays into the
lavas for hunting or collecting by small groups.</p>
<p>The Northern Shoshone were a hunting and
gathering culture directly dependent on what the
land offered. They turned what they could of this
volcanic environment to their benefit. Before
settlement by Europeans, the vicinity of the park
boasted several game species that are rare or absent
from Craters of the Moon today. These included elk,
wolf, bison, grizzly and black bear, and the cougar.
Bighorn sheep, whose males sport characteristic
headgear of large, curled horns, have been absent
from the park since about 1920.</p>
<p>Military explorer U.S. Army Capt. B.L.E. Bonneville
left impressions of the Craters of the Moon lava field
in his travel diaries in the early 1800s. In <i>The
Adventures of Captain Bonneville</i>, which were based
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
on the diaries, 19th-century author Washington Irving
pictures a place &ldquo;where nothing meets the eye but a
desolate and awful waste, where no grass grows nor
water runs, and where nothing is to be seen but lava.&rdquo;
Irving is perhaps most famous for <i>The Legend of
Sleepy Hollow</i>, but his <i>Adventures</i> is considered a
significant period work about the West and provided
this early, if brief, glimpse of a then unnamed Craters
of the Moon.</p>
<p>Pioneers working westward in the 19th century
sought either gold or affordable farm or ranch lands
so they, like the Northern Shoshone, bypassed these
lava wastes. Later, nearby settlers would venture into
this area in search of additional grazing lands. Finding
none, they left Craters of the Moon substantially
alone.</p>
<p>Early pioneers who left traces in the vicinity of the
park did so by following what eventually came to be
known as Goodale&rsquo;s Cutoff. The route was based on
Indian trails that skirted the lava fields in the northern
section of the park. It came into use in the early
1850s as an alternate to the regular route of the
Oregon Trail. Shoshone Indian hostilities along the
Snake River part of the trail&mdash;one such incident is
memorialized in Idaho&rsquo;s Massacre Rocks State Park&mdash;led
the emigrants to search for a safer route. They
were headed for Oregon, particularly the Walla
Walla area around Whitman Mission, family groups
in search of agricultural lands for settlement. Emigrants
traveling it in 1854 noticed names carved in rocks
and trees along its route. It was named in 1862 by
travelers apparently grateful to their guide, Tim
Goodale, whose presence, they felt, had prevented
Indian attacks. Illinois-born Goodale was cut in the
mold of the typical early trapper and trader of the
Far West. He was known to the famous fur trade
brothers Solomon and William Sublette. His name
turned up at such fur trade locales as Pueblo, Taos,
Fort Bridger, and Fort Laramie over a period of at
least 20 years.</p>
<p>After the discovery of gold in Idaho&rsquo;s Salmon
River country, a party of emigrants persuaded Goodale
to guide them over the route they would name for
him. Goodale was an experienced guide: in 1861, he
had served in that capacity for a military survey west
of Denver. The large band of emigrants set out in
July and was joined by more wagons at Craters of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
Moon. Eventually their numbers included 795 men
and 300 women and children. Indian attacks occurred
frequently along the Oregon Trail at that time, but
the size of this group evidently discouraged such
incursions. The trip was not without incident, but
Goodale&rsquo;s reputation remained sufficiently intact for
his clients to affix his name to the route. Subsequent
modifications and the addition of a ferry crossing on
the Snake River made Goodale&rsquo;s Cutoff into a
popular route for western emigration. Traces of it
are still visible in the vicinity of the park today.</p>
<p>Curiosity about this uninhabitable area eventually
led to more detailed knowledge of Craters of the
Moon and knowledge led to its preservation. Geologists
Israel C. Russell and Harold T. Stearns of the U.S.
Geological Survey explored here in 1901 and 1923,
respectively. Taxidermist-turned-lecturer Robert
Limbert explored the area in the early 1920s. Limbert
made three trips. On the first two, he more or less
retraced the steps of these geologists. On his third
and most ambitious trek, Limbert and W. L. Cole
traversed what is now the park and the Craters of the
Moon Wilderness Area south to north, starting from
the nearby community of Minidoka. Their route
took them by Two Point Butte, Echo Crater, Big
Craters, North Crater Flow and out to the Old
Arco-Carey Road, then known as the Yellowstone
Park and Lincoln Highway. These explorations and
their attendant publicity in <i>National Geographic
Magazine</i> were instrumental in the proclamation of
Craters of the Moon as a national monument by
President Calvin Coolidge in 1924.</p>
<p>Since Limbert&rsquo;s day, astronauts have walked both
here and on the moon. Despite our now detailed
knowledge of the differences between these two
places, the name&mdash;and much of the park&rsquo;s awe-inspiring
appeal&mdash;remains the same. It is as though
by learning more about both these niches in our
universe we somehow have learned more about
ourselves as well.</p>

using an alternate route

<p>The first known explorations
of these lava fields were conducted
by two Arco, Idaho, cattlemen
in 1879. Arthur Ferris
and J.W. Powell were looking
for water for their livestock.
The first scientific explorations
were carried out by Israel C.
Russell, surveying the area for
the U.S. Geological Survey in
1901 and 1903. Beginning in
1910, Samuel A. Paisely, later
to become the park&rsquo;s first custodian,
also explored these
lava fields. In 1921, the
U.S.G.S. sent two geologists
here, Harold T. Stearns and
O.E. Meinzer, with a geologist
from the Carnegie Institute.
Based on this field work,
Stearns recommended that a
national monument be created
here. Also during the early 20s,
the explorations of Idaho entrepreneur
Robert W. Limbert
caught the public&rsquo;s fancy. A
report of the explorations of
&ldquo;Two-gun&rdquo; Bob Limbert was
published in the March 1924
<i>National Geographic Magazine</i>.
Limbert was a Boise,
Idaho, taxidermist, tanner, and
furrier. He was also an amateur
wrestler and quick-draw
artist who later performed on
the national lecture circuit.
Reportedly, Limbert once challenged
Al Capone to a pistol
duel at 10 paces. Evidently
Capone declined. Limbert
made three treks into the lava
fields between 1921 and 1924.
He first explored the more easily
accessible northern portion
of the lava fields. Limbert&rsquo;s
third expedition crossed the
area from south to north, however,
starting from Minidoka.</p>

and an Airedale terrier. Taking
the dog along was a mistake,
Limbert wrote, &ldquo;for after three
days&rsquo; travel his feet were worn
raw and bleeding.&rdquo; Limbert
said it was pitiful to watch the
dog as it hobbled after them.
The landscape was so unusual
that Limbert and Cole had difficulty
estimating distances.
Things would be half again as
far away as they had reckoned.
In some areas their compass
needles went wild with magnetic
distortions caused by
high concentrations of iron in
the lava rock. Bizarre features
they found&mdash;such as multi-colored,
blow-out craters&mdash;moved
Limbert to write: &ldquo;I
noticed that at places like these
we had almost nothing to say.&rdquo;
Limbert and Cole discovered
ice caves with ice stalactites.
They found water by tracking
the flights of mourning doves.
They found pockets of cold
water (trapped above ground
by ice deposits below the surface)
covered with yellowjackets
fatally numbed by the cold.
They drank the water anyway.
In desert country, said Limbert,
one can&rsquo;t be too picky. Between
Limbert&rsquo;s lively article
in the <i>National Geographic
Magazine</i>, and the reports of
geologist Stearns, President
Calvin Coolidge was induced
to designate part of the lava
fields as Craters of the Moon

<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">Visitor Center and Programs</span></h2>
<p>The park visitor center is located near
the only entrance to the park. Here
you will find displays and information
to help you plan your visit. Slides,
postcards, maps, and other publications
about the park are displayed for
sale. Park Service rangers at the information
counter can answer your questions
and help you plan your stay in the
park.</p>
<p>The displays alert you to wildflowers
and wild animals you might expect to
see here. Other exhibits describe the
park&rsquo;s geologic history. A film explains
how lava flowed from fissures in the
Earth to create the cinder cones, lava
flows, and other volcanic features you
will see at Craters of the Moon. The
film includes actual footage of eruptions
of the same type that occurred
here some 2,000 years ago. Check at
the visitor center for the schedules of
conducted walks and campfire programs.
You also can get information
here about two self-guiding nature trails
and the park&rsquo;s Loop Drive (see <a href="#Page_59">page 59</a>).</p>
<h4 id="ccc8"><b>Activities and Evening Programs.</b></h4>
<p>In summer, ranger-guided walks and other
programs give visitors an intimate look
at various aspects of the park. Program
schedules vary; we suggest that you
contact the park for current information
prior to arrival. Several sites have
been designed to make it easy to see
the park on your own. The visitor
center is a good place to stop and plan
your visit. Evening programs may find
you wanting a sweater or light jacket to
ward off the chill, despite the hot summer
days. These programs explore such
topics as the park&rsquo;s wildlife and its survival,
the powers of nature, and this landscape&rsquo;s
volcanic origins. Some programs
are illustrated with slides or movies
and take place in the amphitheater.</p>
<h4 id="ccc9"><b>Self-guiding Trails.</b></h4>
<p>Explore three representative
areas of the park on self-guiding
nature trails. <b>Devils Orchard
Trail</b> helps you understand the complex
environmental concerns facing
Craters of the Moon. A pamphlet available
at the trailhead discusses the major
impacts visitors, neighbors, and managers
have on the fragile lava landscape.
Numbered explanations correspond to
markers along the trail. You can walk
this trail in about 20 minutes. <b>North
Crater Flow Trail</b> takes you through a
lava flow that includes rafted blocks
(crater wall fragments) and other interesting
features characteristic of basaltic
lava flows, which are explained by wayside
exhibits. This trail goes through
one of the most recent lava flows in the
park. The shiny lava flows made early
explorers think the volcanic eruptions
had happened only a few years before.
Please stay on trails in this very fragile
area. The park was established to provide
protection for its unusual landscape
features. These require continuing
protection and you can help provide it.
<b>Caves Trail</b> allows you the opportunity
to explore a lava tube. These caves
formed when the surface of lava flow
cooled and hardened while the interior
remained molten and continued to drain.
After the lava drained away, a hollow
tube remained. A pamphlet at the trailhead
provides a map of the cave area
and tells you what to expect as you
explore these lava tubes on your own.
Wayside exhibits point out the most
interesting lava formations along the
trail. To see only Indian Tunnel, the
largest of the lava tubes, will require
nearly one hour.</p>

<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">Take The Driving Tour</span></h2>
<p>You can see most of the features for
which Craters of the Moon is famous
by a combined auto and foot tour
along the Loop Drive. With several
short walks included, you can make
the drive in about two hours. Numbered
stops are keyed to the map in the
park folder.</p>
<p><b>1. Visitor Center.</b> The 7-mile Loop
Drive begins at the visitor center. Most
of the drive is one-way. Spur roads and
trailheads enable you to explore this
lava field even further.</p>
<p><b>2. North Crater Flow.</b> A short foot
trail crosses the North Crater Flow to a
group of crater wall fragments transported
by lava flows. This is one of the
youngest flows here. The triple twist
tree and its 1,350 growth rings have in
the past helped date the recency of the
last flows here. Along this trail you can
see fine examples of pahoehoe lava
and aa lava flows (see <a href="#Page_26">page 26</a>). Just
beyond the North Crater Flow Trail is
the North Crater Trail. This short,
steep, self-guiding nature trail leads
you to the vent overlooking the crater
of a cinder cone.</p>
<p><b>3. Devils Orchard.</b> Devils Orchard
is a group of lava fragments that stand
like islands in a sea of cinders. This
marks the resting place for blocks of
material from the walls of North Crater
that broke free and were rafted
here on lava flows. The short spur road
leads to a self-guiding trail through
these weird features. You can easily
walk the trail in about 20 minutes. An
early morning or evening visit may
allow you to observe park wildlife. In
springtime, the wildflower displays in
the cinder gardens are glorious. In
June and early July, dwarf blooming
monkeyflowers give the ground a magenta
cast.</p>
<p><b>4. Inferno Cone Viewpoint.</b> From
the viewpoint atop Inferno Cone, a
landscape of volcanic cinder cones
spreads before you to the distant mountain
ranges beyond. Notice that the
cooler, moister northern slopes of the
cones bear noticeably more vegetation
than the drier southern slopes, which
receive the brunt of sunshine. If you
take the short, steep walk to the summit
of Inferno Cone, you can easily
recognize the chain of cinder cones
that defines the Great Rift. Perhaps
nowhere else in the park is it so easy to
visualize how the volcanic activity broke
out along this great fissure in the Earth.
Towering in the distance above the
lava plain is Big Cinder Butte, one of
the world&rsquo;s largest, purely basaltic, cinder
cones.</p>
<p><b>5. Big Craters and Spatter Cones
Area.</b> Spatter cones formed along the
Great Rift fissure where clots of pasty
lava stuck together when they fell. The
materials and forces of these eruptions
originated at depths of approximately
40 miles within the Earth. A short,
steep walk to the top of Big Craters
offers a view of a series of volcanic
vents.</p>
<p><b>6. Trails to Tree Molds and the Wilderness
Area.</b> A spur road just beyond
Inferno Cone takes you to trails to the
Tree Molds Area and the Craters of
the Moon Wilderness. Tree molds
formed where molten lava flows encased
trees and then hardened (see
<a href="#Page_27">page 27</a>). The cylindrical molds that
remained after the wood burned and
rotted away range from a few inches to
more than 1 foot in diameter.</p>
<p><b>7. Cave Area.</b> At this final stop on
the Loop Drive, a &frac12;-mile walk takes
you to the lava tubes. Here you can see
Dewdrop, Boy Scout, Beauty, and Surprise
Caves and the Indian Tunnel.
(For how these lava tubes formed, see
<a href="#Page_30">page 30</a>.) Carry a flashlight in all caves
except Indian Tunnel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">Camping and Backcountry Use</span></h2>
<p>The campground has about 50 sites.
These are available on a first-come,
first-served basis. Reservations are not
accepted. A daily fee for camping is
charged. Water and restrooms are provided
in the campground, but there
are no showers, dump station, or hookups.
Wood fires are prohibited in the
park, but grills at each campsite may
be used for charcoal fires. The campground
accommodates both RVs and
tents. During the summer, park rangers
present evening programs at the
campground amphitheater.</p>
<h4 id="ccc10">Backcountry Use.</h4>
<p>Some of the park&rsquo;s
most intriguing landscapes lie beyond
the road&rsquo;s end in the 68-square-mile
Craters of the Moon Wilderness Area.
Only two trails penetrate the wilderness,
and these for only short distances.
After the three-mile trail to
Echo Crater runs out, you are on your
own. For further exploration, you can
simply follow the Great Rift and its
chain of cinder cones. These landmarks
help you find your way.</p>
<p>To explore farther afield, you should
have a good topographic map and basic
map skills. You can purchase such a
map at the visitor center. All hikers
who plan to stay overnight in the wilderness
are required to register with a
park ranger. Backcountry use permits
are available free at the visitor center.</p>
<p><b id="water">Each hiker should carry at least one
gallon of water for each day out</b>; even
more may be necessary during the hot
summer. There is no drinking water
available in the wilderness. The best
times for wilderness travel are May-June
and September-October. Daytime
temperatures are usually mild then,
while nights are cool, but you must be
prepared for inclement and very cold
weather in these transitional months.
Summer daytime temperatures climb
into the 90s, and reflected heat off the
lavas may be even higher. Long distance
hiking is not very pleasant then,
and the weight of necessary drinking
water is burdensome.</p>
<h4 id="ccc11">Safety.</h4>
<p>Sturdy boots and long pants
are necessary gear for the jagged aa
lava flows. Bring clothing for both hot
and cool weather; both can occur the
same day in this desert climate. (See
drinking water warning <a href="#water">above</a>.)</p>
<h4 id="ccc12">Regulations.</h4>
<p>Campfires are prohibited
in the backcountry. Carry a self-contained
backpack stove and fuel.
Mechanized vehicles, including bicycles,
are prohibited in the wilderness
area. Pets are also prohibited in the
wilderness. Pack out everything that
you pack in&mdash;and any trash you find
that others left behind. A good admonition
is: &ldquo;Take only pictures, and try
not to leave so much as a footprint.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">Winter Recreation</span></h2>
<p>The visitor center is open every day
except winter holidays. Winter hours
are 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Wilderness
permits, topographic maps, and information
are available here. To find out
about current snow conditions, call
(208) 527-3257.</p>
<p><b>Skiing.</b> Crosscountry
skiing provides an enjoyable experience
of the park&rsquo;s landscape transformed
by snow. When heavy snows accumulate,
usually in late November, the 7-mile
Loop Drive is closed and it becomes a
natural ski trail. Most of the Loop
Drive follows fairly level terrain. The
best months for skiing are January to
March in most winters. Usually there
is about 18 inches of snowpack by
January and 3 feet by March. Temperatures
range from 45&deg;F to well below
zero. Be prepared for inclement weather
and high winds at all times. Blizzards
may be encountered.</p>
<p><b>Hazards.</b> Skiing
off the Loop Drive is allowed but not
recommended. Most of the park is
covered by sharp, jagged lava, and
snow cover may mask cracks and caverns
underneath.</p>
<p><b>Camping.</b> Winter
camping is permitted in the main campground.
The campground is not plowed;
be prepared to camp in the snow.
Wood fires are not permitted anywhere
in the park.</p>
<p><b>Wilderness use.</b> The wilderness
is ideal for overnight ski trips.
You should be well equipped and experienced
at winter camping, however. A free
wilderness use permit, available at the
visitor center, is required for all overnight
use outside the park campground.</p>

<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">Regulations and Safety</span></h2>
<p>Many management concerns, regulations,
and safety tips are given under
specific subjects in this handbook. Here
are some other things to consider.</p>
<p>Precautions must be taken when you
explore the park because of the rugged
terrain, heat, and lack of naturally
available drinking water. You will need
sturdy boots, a hat, and ample, leakproof
water containers. Make sure containers
are watertight <b>before</b> you leave home.
Exploring caves requires flashlights.</p>
<p>Camp only in the park campground.
All other overnight use, even in winter,
requires a wilderness use permit. A
day-use permit is required to visit the
area of the park that lies north of
Highway 20-26-93.</p>
<h4 id="ccc13">Pets.</h4>
<p>Pets are allowed only in the
campground and on the Loop Drive,
but they must be kept on a leash at all
times. Pets are prohibited in all public
buildings, on trails, or in off-road areas.</p>
<h4 id="ccc14">Vehicles.</h4>
<p>All motor vehicles and bicycles
must stay on paved roads only.
They are not allowed on trails.</p>
<h4 id="ccc15">Firearms.</h4>
<p>Firearm restrictions are enforced:
No hunting is allowed in the
park.</p>
<h4 id="ccc16">Collecting.</h4>
<p>The collection, removal,
or disturbance of any natural features
within the park is strictly prohibited.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
